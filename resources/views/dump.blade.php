  <p>Dear School Administrators,</p>
  <p>Our students and staff's safety and security are paramount in the contemporary
    educational landscape. However, it is a sobering reality that many of our nation's
    schools were constructed at a time when these critical considerations were not at the
    forefront of design and planning. The result is a nationwide portfolio of educational
    facilities that may need more modern security standards, leaving them vulnerable to
    today's evolving threats.
    Recognizing the urgent need to address these challenges, we have leveraged stateof-the-art technology to provide a comprehensive Safety and Vulnerability
    Assessment through our digital site assessment mobile app, SITE|SAFETYNETâ„ .
    This digital report is not only a reflection of our commitment to employing the latest
    technology to safeguard our students but also a versatile tool that can be shared and
    utilized in various ways </p>
  <ul>
    <li>For Discussion: Engage stakeholders...</li>
    <li>Tabletop Discussions: Utilize the report...</li>
    <li>Safety Triage and Improvements: Leverage...</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The report you are about to review includes a detailed analysis of your school's risk
identification score, demography, areas for improvement, and specific
recommendations. It is meticulously designed to evaluate K-12 schools nationwide,
focusing on identifying strengths, deficiencies, and weaknesses relative to school
shootings, gun safety, and active shooter prevention.
By embracing this digital format, we ensure a swift and efficient assessment and
provide a dynamic platform that can be instrumental in formulating and executing a
robust safety strategy. We can take decisive steps towards a safer and more secure
educational environment.
Your partnership in this vital endeavor is greatly appreciated.

  </p>
  <p>Sincerely,<br>Protecting Our Students, Inc.</p>
